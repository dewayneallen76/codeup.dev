   <h2>Ice Cream Cone Exercise</h2>
   <script>
   	 "use strict";

// An ice cream seller can't go home until she sells all of her cones. Write a JS program that generates a random number between 50 and 100 representing the amount of cones to sell. Your code should generate numbers between 1 and 5, simulating the amount of cones being bought by her clients. Use a do-while loop to log to the console the amount of cones sold to each person. This is how you get the random numbers.

// // This is how you get a random number between 50 and 100
// var allCones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 50;
// // This is how you get a random number between 1 and 5
// var cones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
// The output should be similar to the following:

// 5 cones sold...  // if there are enough cones
// Cannot sell you 6 cones I only have 3...  // If there are not enough cones
// Yay! I sold them all! // If there are no more cones

// This is how you get a random number between 50 and 100
var allCones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 50;
// // This is how you get a random number between 1 and 5
// var cones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
console.log("I have " + allCones  + " cones to sell.");
// var remainingCones = (allCones - cones);

do {
		var cones = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;	
	 if (allCones >= cones){
		console.log("Someone bought " + cones + " cones.")
		allCones = allCones - cones
		console.log(allCones + " are left.")
	}else {
		console.log("I do not have enough cones.") };
} 
while (allCones >= 1)
	console.log("I have sold all of the cones and I never want to see another ice cream cone for the rest of my life.");

// Use inline JavaScript to create a while loop that uses console.log() to create the output shown below.

var i = 1;

while (i < 65536) {
	i = i * 2
    console.log(i);
}
