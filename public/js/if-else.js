/*HEB has an offer for the clients that buy products amounting more than $200. The discount is 35% off the purchase. 
Write a JS program, using conditionals, that logs to the browser, how much Ryan, Cameron and George need to pay. 
We know that Cameron bought $180, Ryan $250 and George $320. Your program will have to display a line with the name
 of the person, the amount before the discount, if any, and the amount after the discount. 
The output of your code should be similar to the following one:
Luis bought $100.00, no discount was applied. Final payment: $100.00.
Zach bought $220.00, discount was applied. Final payment: $143.00.*/
